# <span style="color:darkblue">Some words to start with</span>
**Welcome to the page!** This is an essential part of my final assignment to the course "Introduction to Open Data Science", or as we friends call it "IODS" course. My name is Laura Matkala and I am a PhD student who studies forests. I have to say this is one of the most inspiring courses I have taken in a while. I will do my best with all the new skills I have learned during the course to make a best possible outcome for this assignment!

#<span style="color:darkblue">About the dataset</span>

I chose to use the dataset <span style="color:red">Boston</span>, which includes data about housing in the suburbs of Boston , Massachusettes, USA. I will later perform <span style="background:yellow">linear regression</span> and <span style="background:yellow">logistic regression</span> to the variable <span style="color:red">"crime"</span>,  but first some basic information about the dataset.

I have standardized the dataset beforehand as well as explored it a bit. You can find the R script file with all the data wrangling and codes [here](https://github.com/LauraMatkala/IODS-final/blob/master/data_wrangling_final.R). The variables in the dataset are:


* <span style="color:green">crime = per capita crime rate by town (high, medium low, medium high, high)</span>
* <span style="color:purple">zn = proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft</span>
* <span style="color:green">indus = proportion of non-retail business acres per town</span>
* <span style="color:purple">chas = Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)</span>
* <span style="color:green">nox = nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)</span>
* <span style="color:purple">crm = average number of rooms per dwelling</span>
* <span style="color:green">age = proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940</span>
* <span style="color:purple">dis = weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centres</span>
* <span style="color:green">rad = index of accessibility to radial highways</span>
* <span style="color:purple">tax = full-value property-tax rate per \$10,000</span>
* <span style="color:green">ptratio = pupil-teacher ratio by town</span>
* <span style="color:purple">black = 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town</span>
* <span style="color:green">lstat = lower status of the population (percent)</span>
* <span style="color:purple">medv = median value of owner-occupied homes in \$1000s</span> 



#<span style="color:darkblue">Analysis</span>
###<span style="color:darkblue">Linear regression</span>

I will create a linear multiple regression model, which uses <span style="color:red">"rad"</span>, <span style="color:red">"dis"</span> and <span style="color:red">"ptratio"</span> as explanatory variables for <span style="color:red">"crime"</span>.
