# Some words to start with
Welcome to the page! This is an essential part of my final assignment to the course "Introduction to Open Data Science", or as we friends call it "IODS" course. I will do my best with all the new skills I have learned during the course to make a best possible outcome for this assignment. You can find the file with all the data wrangling codes [here](https://github.com/LauraMatkala/IODS-final/blob/master/data_wrangling_final.R).

```{r sk?p?d??, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE} 
#above an example of a chunk, messages and warnings should be disabled now.

```
